                     Greetings! I'm Kylychbek Parpiev, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself.
                    I'm currently pursuing my studies in Computer Science at the Ala-Too International University. My educational journey has instilled in me a passion for 
                    coding and equipped me with a strong foundation in various areas of IT.
                     I have been honing a diverse set of skills, encompassing communication skills, problem solving, teamwork and collaboration and coding/programming. 
                    These competencies allow me to approach challenges with confidence and creativity. 
                    I'm committed to continuous growth and am always eager to expand my skills to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in IT.
                     Outside of academia, I'm interested in playing basketball, volleyball, reading books, solving Rubic's cude and listening to music, 
                    which offer me a sense of balance and inspiration. 
                     Whether I'm playing basketball or reading a book, these activities provide fresh perspectives that I bring to my work.
                    On a personal note, I'm very curious and always want to expand my knowledge. Also I'm driven by a commitment 
                    to make a meaningful contribution to our world.

                        <h2>A website about Steve Jobs</h2>
                        <p>We created a website about Steve Jobs using HTML & CSS & JS and also 
                            we were using the platform which was called "Codepen".
                            Codepen's collaborative features may have allowed multiple team members 
                            to work on the project simultaneously, sharing code and making real-time updates.
                            The project might have been a great opportunity for learning and skill development, 
                            as it likely required knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                        <h2>A website about big tables</h2>
                        <p>In this website we created we learnt how to make big tables and how to use rowspans and colspans.
                            Creating tables with large datasets and using rowspan and colspan is a valuable learning experience for web developers. 
                            It helps improve skills in data presentation and problem-solving.

                        <h2>A welcome website about our University</h2>
                        <p>We created the website where we learnt how to use JS, how to use functions and to change objects on the site.
                            Learning how to use JavaScript functions and manipulate objects on a website is an exciting and rewarding journey. 
                            It provides valuable skills in web development, 
                            and you can gradually build more advanced projects as you become more proficient.
                            Following best practices for JavaScript coding, such as keeping code organized, optimizing performance, 
                            and testing thoroughly, is crucial for creating reliable and efficient web applications.
